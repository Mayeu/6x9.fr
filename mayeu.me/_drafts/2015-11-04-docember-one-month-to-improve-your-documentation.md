On the first of November, while I was checking my Twitter stream, I got a nice
mix between the recently started [NaNoWriMo], and [Steve Klabnik][steveKlabnik]
& [Ashley G. Williams][ashleyGWilliams] tweets about documentation in open
source project. The brain being what it is, a link was made between those two
ideas and I thought it would be cool to have an event similar to the NaNoWriMo
but oriented to documentation writing. Thus, I tweeted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr"> What about a National Documentation Writing Month? Write at least 50k words of doc for your/others projects. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NaNoWriMo?src=hash">#NaNoWriMo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NaDoWriMo?src=hash">#NaDoWriMo</a> </p>&mdash; Mayeu (@Mayeu) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mayeu/status/660926951163617280">November 1, 2015</a> </blockquote>

Knowing that I won't be able to reach enough people with my account only,
[I shamelessly poke Steve Klabnik][shamlessTweet] since I was pretty sure this
will be relevant to him. He kindly share this idea, and this led [Matool] to
propose the awesome *« [DOCember][docemberName] »* name, replacing the clumsy *«
**NaDoWriMo** »* I proposed. The three of us decided that we should write a blog
post on this project, so there is mine :)

## So what will be DOCember?

The idea is to promote the fact that documenting your project is actually pretty
critical for its adoption and its quality, and to help you start by creating a
global movement around it. The parallel with [InkTober] (1 drawing every day
during October) and the [NaNoWriMo] (Writing a 50.000 words novel during November)
is evident, and I believe those two events works because:

* *They are a personal challenges*, maintaining the rhythm and finishing
  successfully is not easy, this being a motivation in itself.
* *You improve at the same time*, it offer you a setting that help you to work
  regularly on your skills, so even if you don't finish the challenge, you
  worked and improved yourself through it.

So, during December, **one should aim at merging the equivalent of 25
pull-request enhancing the documentation of one's or others' project·s** (may it
be a public one, or an company internal one). You can span this on the whole
month, or you can try to make it one merge each days until Christmas. **It can
be a personal challenge** (helping your project, or someone else project by
documenting it), or **a community one** (organizing your community to make
documentation a priority during this month). Make it whatever match your
situation, the goal is first and foremost to raise awareness and enhance
documentation.

Obviously, we need your help to share the love of good documentation out. So if
you care about good documentation, please share the idea around you, tweet about
it, discuss it in your organization, etc. I'll try to be as available as much as
possible on twitter about that :)
