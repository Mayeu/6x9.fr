#Hi, I am Matthieu Maury
I am freelancer sysadmin and software developper, and you may [hire me](#).

I like to write [code](https://github.com/Mayeu) and sometimes [words](/blog).

In software, I am interested in FOSS, automation and privacy.

In life, I have a keen interest in tea and meditation practices.
