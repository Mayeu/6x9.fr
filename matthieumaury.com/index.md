title: sysadmin, automation & tea
---

#Hi, I am Matthieu «Mayeu» Maury

I am an independent sysadmin, «devops», and software developer. I'm available for [contracting jobs and consulting](/contact).

I like to write [code](https://github.com/Mayeu) and sometimes [words](/blog).

In software, I am interested in FOSS, automation and privacy.

In life, I have a keen interest in tea and meditation practices.
