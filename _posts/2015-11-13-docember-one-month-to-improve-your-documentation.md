## Some background

On the first of November, while I was checking my Twitter stream, I got a nice
mix between the recently started [NaNoWriMo], and [Steve Klabnik][steveKlabnik]
& [ Ashley G. Williams][ashleyGWilliams] tweets about documentation in open
source projects. The brain being what it is, a link was made between those two
ideas and I thought it would be cool to have an event similar to the NaNoWriMo
but oriented to documentation writing. Thus, I tweeted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr"> What about a National Documentation Writing Month? Write at least 50k words of doc for your/others projects. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NaNoWriMo?src=hash">#NaNoWriMo </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NaDoWriMo?src=hash">#NaDoWriMo </a> </p>&mdash; Mayeu (@Mayeu) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mayeu/status/660926951163617280"> November 1, 2015 </a> </blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr"> Raise awareness of the importance of good documentation for our users (users: from the non-technical to the experimented/core dev) </p>&mdash; Mayeu (@Mayeu) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mayeu/status/660930646513164288"> November 1, 2015 </a> </blockquote>

Knowing that, I won’t be able to reach enough people with my account only,
[I shamelessly poke Steve Klabnik][shamlessTweet] since I was pretty sure this
will be interesting to him. He kindly shared this idea, and this led [Matool] to
propose the awesome *"[DOCember][docemberName]"* name, replacing the clumsy
*"**NaDoWriMo**"* I proposed. The three of us then decided that we should write
blog posts about this project, so here is mine :) You can also see the one [Steve Klabnik wrote][steveDocember].

## So what will be DOCember?

*In the following I’ll use "project" loosely for anything that could be helped
by a documentation. It can represent a coding project, organization at large, or
processes inside a project/group/organization.*

The idea is to promote the fact that documenting your project is actually pretty
critical for its quality and adoption. The parallel with [InkTober] (1 drawing
every day of October) and the [NaNoWriMo] (Writing a 50,000 word novel during
November) is evident, and I believe those two events are working because:

* *They are a personal challenge*, maintaining the pace and finishing
successfully is not easy. Being able to reach the end, becoming a motivation in
itself.
* *You improve at the same time*, it offers you a setting that help you to work
regularly on your skills. Even if you don’t finish the challenge, you worked and
improved yourself through it.

So, during December, **one should aim at merging the equivalent of 25
pull-request enhancing the documentation of one’s or others’ project·s** (may it
be public projects, or company internal ones). It can be any form of
documentation: API types and functions, tutorials on using your tool,
on-boarding people in your company, project processes… You name it. You can spin
this on the whole month, or you can try to make it one merge each day until
Christmas. **It can be a personal challenge** (helping your project, or someone
else project by documenting it), or **a community one** (organizing your
community to make documentation a priority during this month). **Make it
whatever match your situation**, the goal is foremost to raise awareness,
enhance documentation, and having fun doing so!

Obviously, we need your help to share the love of good documentation out. So if
this idea appeals to you, please share it around you, tweet about it, discuss it
in your organization, etc. I’ll try to be available as much as possible on
twitter about that :)
